#Khan Academy Visualizations

This repo exists to provide version control to illustrations for Khan Academy concepts. Each of the files here represents a different project built for the platform.

The code here is written in Processing.js and is intended to be pasted into the Khan Academy programming environment to run. In light of the fact that these are drawn on an HTML canvas, there's not an accompanying test suite for them.

As a general rule, I followed object-oriented principles, building a constructor function for any figure that would be drawn more than once. Below is a list of the completed illustrations and the link to the accompanying Khan Academy page.
